PIPPA is an open source package that alllows easy creation of non-linear narratives.


|================================================|
| Background                                     |
|================================================|

The PIPPA package has been developped based on the Total Pain project, where the user/student has a specific amount of time to navigate through the patient's non-linear story.

The non-linear story and time restriction keep the student from viewing all the pieces of the story. 
Each student is building his/her own interpretation of the patient's story individually. Then, the students are grouped together in interprofessional teams and ask to exchange and share with the group. Ultimately they will create a collective understanding of the patient.

By its ease of use and simplicity, PIPPA can be adapted to multiple disciplines and even more.

Activate the required modules first before proceeding to PIPPA's. For some reason it won't work if you enable PIPPA along with the others all in one shot :

.Chaos Tools
.Bundle Copy
.References
.Node Reference
.Views


Then enable :

.PIPPA

.Media
.Links to ongoing narratives
.Pause
.Statistics (the one in the PIPPA package)
.Visited Links

Conceptualizeing a non-linear narrative is actually a rather long and complicated process.
